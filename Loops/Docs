Loops: A loop can execute a bit of function number of times.

Different Kinds of Loops
JavaScript supports different kinds of loops:

for - loops through a block of code a number of times
for/in - loops through the properties of an object
for/of - loops through the values of an iterable object
while - loops through a block of code while a specified condition is true
do/while - also loops through a block of code while a specified condition is true


for loop scope: 
         a) let keyword: it does not redeclare the value once after declaration inside the loop
         b) var keyword: it can redeclare the value once after declaration inside the loop
